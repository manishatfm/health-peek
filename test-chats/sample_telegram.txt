Hey, are you free to talk?

15.12.2023 14:32 Sarah Johnson
Of course! What's going on?

15.12.2023 14:35 John Smith
I've been feeling really anxious lately about everything 😰

15.12.2023 14:40 Sarah Johnson
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what's triggering it?

15.12.2023 14:45 John Smith
Mostly work stress and some personal stuff

15.12.2023 14:50 Sarah Johnson
That sounds tough. Have you considered talking to someone professional?

15.12.2023 14:55 John Smith
I've been thinking about it but haven't taken the step yet

15.12.2023 15:00 Sarah Johnson
It could really help! There's no shame in getting support 💪

15.12.2023 15:10 John Smith
You're right. I'll look into it this week

15.12.2023 15:15 Sarah Johnson

Couldn't have done it without your encouragement

16.12.2023 10:15 Sarah Johnson
You did this yourself! I just reminded you that you're worth taking care of 💙
